## Background
Ceres Solver is a C++ library used to optimize large and complicated problems. In particular Ceres is known for being able to solve Non-linear Least Squares problems. It has been used by Google for over a decade. 

Features of the library include a robust modeling API that supports Derivatives, Loss Functions and Manifolds; as well as a recognition system to implement the most appropriate optimization algorithm to best suit the needs of a system when solving complex problems like Non-linear Conjugate Gradients and Levenburg-Marquardt methods.
